Where we are going to make a design science project whit implementation of sensors to a smart environmental house to collect data, use CI/CD with combination of over-the-air updates push code to our sensors to enhance to time it takes to deploy and for easier maintainability. By using these over-the-air updates we have to do remote debugging to know that our updates actually works.
